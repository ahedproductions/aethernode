A Reticulum Network stationary transport/discovery enabled node - RRNode. 
Designed around OrangePI Zero LTE, an AZDelivery NodeMCU ESP32 and a CDEBYTE E22-400M33S LoRa radio.
It has a built in power supply block, that takes from 18VDC to 53VDC, being designed for the nominal Power Over Ethernet(PoE) voltage of 48VDC,
and provides 5V@6A to power the RNode and the SBC, running RNS.
The node will provide up to 33dBm (2W) of output power.
